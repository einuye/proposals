[Nerine](https://github.com/einuye/proposals/blob/master/ndb-specifications.txt) - RFCs & Proposals
----
Changes to the Nerine landscape have to be made to adapt it as a database to many challenges to it's ecosystem, and this repository exists as a way to formally change it as a landscape and outline the design behind the design of it. Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the ecossytem and standard libraries.
